# Build Runner for VSCode

### 🔨 Run [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) commands conveniently

### [📦 Get it on the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GaetSchwartz.build-runner)

## 🌟 Features

- Launch `build_runner build` with `CTRL+SHIFT+B` (`CMD+SHIFT+B` on Mac).

- Launch `build_runner build` with `--build-filter` by using `CTRL+ALT+B` (`CMD+ALT+B` on Mac) to only rebuild the selected file. Way faster than the regular build. (Thanks to [@luke_pighetti](https://twitter.com/luke_pighetti))

- Start watching your entire project using `build_runner watch` by pressing the extension button on the status bar on the bottom.
