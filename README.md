# Build Runner for VSCode

### 🔨 Run [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) commands conveniently.

## 🌟 Features

* Launch `build_runner build` with `CTRL+SHIFT+B` (`CMD+SHIFT+B` on Mac).

* Launch `build_runner build` with `--build-filter` by using `CTRL+ALT+B` (`CMD+ALT+B` on Mac) to only rebuild the selected file. Way faster than the regular build. (Thanks to [@luke_pighetti](https://twitter.com/luke_pighetti)) 

* Start watching your entire project using `build_runner watch` by pressing the extension button on the status bar on the bottom.

## 📦 How to setup

1.  Make sure `build_runner` is set up properly, read its [documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner). 
2.  That should be it.

🐛 If you encounter any issue feel free to open an issue. *Please make sure it is not a `build_runner` issue first, try running the `build_runner` command equivalent.*
